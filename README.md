# Source Map RFCs

This repository holds RFCs for the the Source Map debugging format. It is
intended to be a place for gestating ideas and discussing extensions to the
[Source Map v3 format][spec].

Open discussion happens in the [GitHub issues][issues].

The process generally goes like this:

* Open an issue for desired functionality you'd like source maps to support.
* Discussion ensues around how best to provide that functionality by extending
  the format and with what semantics consumers should use this data.
* A draft proposal for the format and semantics is submitted.
* Positive consensus is reached, and the draft proposal is regarded up to snuff.
* The proposal is incorporated into the specification.
