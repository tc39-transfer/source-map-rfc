# Source Maps

This repository holds RFCs and the different revisions of the source map specification. It is intended to be a place for gestating ideas and discussing extensions to the [Source Map v3 format][spec].

Open discussion happens in the [GitHub issues][issues].

The process generally goes like this:

- Open an issue for desired functionality you'd like source maps to support.
- Discussion ensues around how best to provide that functionality by extending
  the format and with what semantics consumers should use this data.
- A draft proposal for the format and semantics is submitted.
- Positive consensus is reached, and the draft proposal is regarded up to snuff.
- The proposal is incorporated into the specification.

[spec]: https://tc39.es/source-map-spec/
[issues]: https://github.com/source-map/source-map-rfc/issues

The first and second revision of the spec are provided for historical context.
These revisions don't have widespread adoption in tools.

## Source Map Specification

The most recent specification is the v3 revision. It's converted into MarkDown
format for this repository.

- [Revision 3](source-map-rev3.md)

There is an ongoing initiative to harden the specification, clarify it and to
convert it into a stronger standard. The draft of this initiative can be found here:

- [Draft Source](source-map.bs)
- [Rendered Draft](https://tc39.es/source-map-spec/)
- [RFC and Discussions](https://github.com/source-map/source-map-rfc/)

Older revisions:

- [Revision 2](source-map-rev2.md)
